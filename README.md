## Getting Started

Dear Eve, this is all static HTML right now. You use Atom for text editing, everything is deployed automatically through GitHub Pages when pushed to the master branch.

### Notes

* Use `grunt dev` for dev work
* You've got caching set up on CloudFlare, so if you deploy you need to do the Purge Cache option in the Cache tab (on CloudFlare)
