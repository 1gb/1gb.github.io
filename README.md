My online portfolio, featuring projects I've worked on, about me, etc.

### Notes

* Work on the `code` branch, `master` is just what gets published
* `npm install`
* Use `grunt dev` for dev work
* Use `grunt build` to spit out the static site to public/build/* and then move it to the `master` branch
* You've got caching set up on CloudFlare, so if you deploy you need to do the Purge Cache option in the Cache tab (on CloudFlare)
